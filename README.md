### Disclaimer
There are several modifications made from Krish Naik's reference. The model is not deployed as a website; instead, an API model is created using FastAPI. The frontend used is Streamlit to test the functionality of the API. Additionally, modifications have been made to the logger.py code to make it usable in Docker environment.

For the full tutorial, please refer to Krish Naik's YouTube channel.
